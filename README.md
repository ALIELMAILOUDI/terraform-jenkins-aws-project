This project automates the deployment of a high-availability AWS architecture using Terraform and Jenkins. The architecture consists of an Auto Scaling Group and an Application Load Balancer, all deployed within a separate VPC.

The project is divided into two parts:

    Part 1: Committing Terraform configuration code HCL in GitHub.
    Part 2: Deploying the application to the AWS infrastructure using Jenkins through the HCL code in GitHub.
