## Deploying High-Availability Two-Tier AWS Architecture with Terraform and Jenkins

This project automates the deployment of a high-availability AWS architecture using Terraform and Jenkins. The architecture comprises a web tier that handles user requests and a database tier for data storage. I leveraged Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision and manage AWS resources efficiently.

The project is divided into two parts:

    Part 1: Committing Terraform configuration code HCL in GitHub.
    Part 2: Deploying the application to the AWS infrastructure using Jenkins through the HCL code in GitHub.
